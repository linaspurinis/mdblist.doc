## Score

The score is calculated using all the ratings average and with a votes baseline. The baseline is different for every rating type, and if the vote count is lower than the baseline, the rating is decreased with the exception of current year movies and shows. 

## Score Average

If the score is modified by the lack of votes (votes baseline), the Score Average is displayed alongside the modified Score. You can filter by Score or Score average, depending on your needs.
