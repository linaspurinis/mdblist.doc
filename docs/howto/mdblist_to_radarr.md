# Add mdblist.com list to Radarr

In this example we want to add  
[https://mdblist.com/lists/linaspurinis/mdblist-com-most-popular-movies](https://mdblist.com/lists/linaspurinis/mdblist-com-most-popular-movies) list to Radarr.  

*To find your list URL, go to [My Lists](https://mdblist.com/mylists/) and click on Copy URL icon*
{: .code-example }
  
In Radarr app, go to Settings > Lists and click on +

![](/assets/images/radarr_plus.jpg)

Select Advanced List > Custom Lists

![](/assets/images/radarr_custom_list_select.jpg)

Fill in the parameters.  

![](/assets/images/radarr_mdblist_list.jpg)

Using mdblist lists directly with Radarr, marks owners list active and prevents itâ€™s (free) account for being expired.
